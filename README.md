  > There’s a feeling in the air. A zeitgeist. SPAs are no longer the cool kids they once were 10 years ago.

  > Single page apps are all the rage today, but they don't always operate the same as traditional web pages.

[Have Single-Page Apps Ruined the Web?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=860d8usGC0o) (2021)
  > SPAs solve problems to the traditional approach, but are still problematic.

[Second-guessing the modern web](https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html) (2020)
  > We’re layering optimizations upon optimizations in order to get the SPA-like pattern to fit every use case, and I’m not sure that it is, well, worth it.

[You probably don't need a single-page application](https://plausible.io/blog/you-probably-dont-need-a-single-page-app) (2019)
  > All of this means that single-page applications impose more complexity and cognitive load on the developers.

  > The Preact stuff is kind of fun. But it feels like adding a lot of complexity, and I can’t pin down how it benefits most of these projects.

[Single Page Application is not a Silver Bullet](https://blog.bloomca.me/2018/02/04/spa-is-not-silver-bullet.html) (2018)
  > the problem is that nowadays pretty often question is not “to SPA or not to SPA”, rather “which client-side framework should we use for our SPA”.

[The Architecture No One Needs](https://www.gregnavis.com/articles/the-architecture-no-one-needs.html) (2018)
  > Single-page apps are all the rage nowadays. Many praise their vague technical benefits while ignoring tremendous development costs.

[Why I hate your Single Page App](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-i-hate-your-single-page-app-f08bb4ff9134) (2016)

[The disadvantages of single page applications](https://adamsilver.io/blog/the-disadvantages-of-single-page-applications/) (2014)
  > Many people think SPAs provide faster and better experiences but in reality they create a slower, unfamiliar and inaccessible experience. Worse is that they’re harder to make in the first place.
